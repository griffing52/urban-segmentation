# SAM3 Batch Generation Configuration
# Generate masks for multiple strategies and prompt levels in one run

# Data paths
data:
  root: "../data/cityscapes"
  splits: ["val"]  # or ["train", "val"] for full generation
  output_dir: "../generated_masks"
  max_images: null  # Set to a number (e.g., 50) for testing, null for all images

# Methods to generate (can specify multiple)
methods:
  - baseline
  - multi_crop
  - tiled

# Prompt levels to test (can specify multiple)
prompts:
  - L1_Baseline
  - L2_Descriptive
  - L3_Physical
  - L4_Specific

# Multi-crop grid configurations
# Each grid will create a separate run for each prompt level
multi_crop:
  grid_sizes:
    - [2, 2]  # Standard 2x2 grid
    - [1, 2]  # Horizontal split
    # - [3, 3]  # Finer grid (slower but better coverage)

# Tiled window configurations  
# Each stride will create a separate run for each prompt level
tiled:
  window_size: 1024  # Fixed window size
  strides:
    - 256   # High overlap (slower, best quality)
    - 512   # Medium overlap (balanced)
    # - 768   # Low overlap
    # - 1024  # No overlap (fastest)

# Processing settings
processing:
  num_workers: 4
  verbose: true
  device: "cuda"
